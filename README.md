This is a particle shooter game that I made in order to learn more about HTML5 Canvas and get better at Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript.

#### Idea:

The player is trying to survive from a horde of incoming enemies (Particles). The player shoots projectiles by clicking the mouse in a certain directions. The player has one life so if the enemy touches the player it is GAME OVER. A score is being accumulated on the side. It shows after the game is done.
